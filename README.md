# Arduino-Bluetooth-Control-for-Boat-Mechanism
## AIM
1. Remote Navigation: Develop a system to  control the boat remotely via a smartphone,  enabling users to navigate the boat from a  distance using a mobile application,arduino uno and bluetooth module.

2. Live Streaming Capability: Implement live  streaming functionality on the boat, allowing  users to view real-time video footage captured by  onboard cameras directly on their smartphones.
## COMPONENTS 
1. ESP32 : for High-resolution	camera	module	for	image  capture and transmission
2. HC-05 Bluetooth Module :	Enables	wireless communication with external devices.
3. Arduino uno : for the connection and signal transmission from the app to the boat
4. Servo Motor (9g): Small motor used for precise rudder control in  boats.
5. DC	Motor:	Component for converting electrical	energy into  mechanical motion
6. 9V Battery: Power source for the DC motor's operation and arduino uno.
